# Restart TS server Status Bar button

The TypeScript Language Server becomes slow over long period of usage and sometimes gets stuck when changing files outside of VS Code (eg. changing git branches). This extension adds a convenient _Restart TS server_ button to the Status Bar which allows you to quickly restart the TS server:

Inspired by the [Restart Your TS Server](https://github.com/HearTao/restart-your-ts-server) extension, which does the same for touch bars.
